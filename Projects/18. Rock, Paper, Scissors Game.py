# To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the userâ€™s choice and 
# then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices, 
# and if the user wins then the score will increase by 1:

            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
            comp_score += 1
